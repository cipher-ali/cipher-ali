## Hello Fellas ðŸ‘‹
Despite my username being "cipher-ali", I don't do any ciphering, nor do I do work in cybersecurity. I use C++.
I have created some silly little text-based games, and now I learned a little bit about 2D game development using SDL2!
Right now, I am working on a text game based on the iconic FNAF 1 (I got into FNAF again...)
