## Hello Everyone 👋
Despite my username being "cipher-ali", I don't do any ciphering, nor do I do work in cybersecurity.
Just another teenager who likes video games, speaking of which...

- 🎮 I am focusing on using C++ along with a graphics library called "SDL2" (version 2.30.10) for creating games.
- 🖼️ I haven't done much involving graphics yet, but I'm eager to dive deeper into it.
- 😊 I would really appreciate if you could give me feedback on how to better organize my code and avoid repitition.

ok bye bye
