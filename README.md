## Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹
Despite my username being "cipher-ali", I don't do any ciphering, nor do I do work in cybersecurity.
I am practing C++ programming by making console/text games, and I'll eventually move on to making silly video games using SDL2!
Currently working on a Pokemon text game, I would love some feedback on the "great" code
